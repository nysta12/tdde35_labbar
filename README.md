# Computer Networks
Welcome to the repository of the *Computer Networks* courses!

<!---[TDDE35: Large-Scale Distributed Systems and Networks](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDE35/labs/)-->

This course has 4 lab assignments:
* [Assignment 1: Wireshark lab. Getting started + HTTP](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/tree/master/lab1-wireshark)
* [Assignment 2: Net Ninny. A Web Proxy Based Service](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/tree/master/lab2-proxy)
* [Assignment 3: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/tree/master/lab3-tcp)
* [Assignment 4: Distance Vector Routing](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/tree/master/lab4-routing)

**Read this file till the end! Assignments that are handed in incorrectly will be automatically rejected.**

Assignment instructions can be found on the web-page for your course code (e.g. [TDDE35](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDE35/labs/)).
Additional submission and report requirements are located in subfolders (e.g. [networks/lab1-wireshark](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/tree/master/lab1-wireshark), [networks/lab2-proxy](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/tree/master/lab2-proxy), etc.).


Submit solutions and reports using **your gitlab repository, which must be a *private* fork of the repository [nikko22/networks](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks)**. A fork is essentially a copy of a repository that is cloned into your own account.

These instructions describe how to (i) create a forked repository and (ii) hand-in assignments via the repository and email.

Also, see [Virtual lab sessions](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks/-/issues).


## Getting started

### 0. Log into gitlab.liu.se with your LiU-ID

### 1. Fork the repository [nikko22/networks](https://gitlab.liu.se/nikko22/networks)

Press the "Fork" button on the top of this page to copy this repository to your account.

Then, on the next page that pops up, choose your account:


> <img src="/pictures/fork2_image.png"  width="500"> 
---

After successfully forking the repository, you will see the following message:

### 2. Make your fork private!

Your forked repository **must be made private**.

Find the "Settings" button on the left side of the forked repository's main page, and click 'General' to change the permissions of your project.

Expand 'Permissions', set 'Project visibility' to 'Private', and then save changes.

### 4. Work on the assignments

You may want to download the content of your repository to work on the lab assignments. If you are familiar with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), then you can use it to work with your forked repository. Otherwise, it is perhaps easier to use the download option on the main page of the repository.

After downloading the contents of your repository, you can start working on the assignments. The repository contains 4 assignment folders. **Check out assignment folders for submission instructions.**

### 5. Place your code and a report into the forked repository
After completing an assignment, edit/upload the files to your forked repository.

If there exists an example report in a lab folder, then you can edit it in your browser:

---
Or, you can also upload files to the folders of your repository:

---
### 6. Submit by sending an email with a link to your repository
To submit an assignment, *email an address of your repository* to your lab assistant. The subject of the email letter *must* adhere to the following pattern: 
* **CourseCode_Year_labNumber_userName1_userName2** 
(e.g., TDDE35_2020_lab4_hrsdv94_dgjjt92).
